# DataCorrelation

This project is used to find the correlation in the movie data-set.
Along with this project. I improved my skills in python with pandas and seaborn in order to draw correlation charts.

The data set is avialable at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies). Also I have added dataset into the [data](/data/) folder.
